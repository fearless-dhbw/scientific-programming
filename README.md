# Scientific Programming Project - Athlete Image Classification Project

__Aim:__ The aim of the project is to use the Python Programming Concepts and Machine Learning Algorithms learnt in class on a project to challenge ourselves and grow in the process.

## For my data science and machine learning project, I decided to image classify some popular Sport Celebrities:

-  Lionel Messi
- Virat Kohli
- Maria Sharapova
- Venus Williams
- Roger Federer


## Highlights:

- Took raw truth data and worked from preprocessing, processing and training data model
- Used wavelet transform and raw pixel data to detect images. Used SVM to create a confusion matrix with relatively high accuracy.
- Used confusion matrix to plot data
- Created Frontend and Backend data

## The folder structure:

- __Frontend__ : This contains ui website code (unfortunately still buggy)
- __server__: Python flask server
- __model__: Contains python notebook for model building including python model
- __images_dataset__: Dataset used for our model training

## Technologies used in this project:
- Python
- Numpy and OpenCV for data cleaning
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
- Sklearn for model building
- Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
- Python flask for http server (buggy)
- Vite, React, HTML, TailwindCSS and Nextjs for Frontend

## Must-have Requirements for the code to run

- PyWavelets
- opencv-python
- seaborn
