# Scientific Programming Project - Athlete Image Classification Project

## For my data science and machine learning project, I decided to image classify some popular Sport Celebrities:

1. Lionel Messi
2. Virat Kohli
3. Maria Sharapova
4. Venus Williams
5. Roger Federer

## The folder structure:

__Frontend__ : This contains ui website code (unfortunately still buggy)
__server__: Python flask server
__model__: Contains python notebook for model building including python model
__images_dataset__: Dataset used for our model training

## Technologies used in this project:
- Python
- Numpy and OpenCV for data cleaning
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
- Sklearn for model building
- Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
- Python flask for http server (buggy)
- Vite, React, HTML, TailwindCSS and Nextjs for Frontend

## Must-have Requirements

PyWavelets
opencv-python
seaborn
